## :sparkling_heart:  Support my projects

This project will be open source and will be available to the public with their respective updates. Since all the new knowledge that I acquire will be fed back into the repository.

However, if you get any benefit out of this or just want to encourage me to keep creating things, there are a few ways you can do it:
- Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
- [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations] You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
- [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon] Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting concept art images (things that I don't share with everyone). :smiley:
